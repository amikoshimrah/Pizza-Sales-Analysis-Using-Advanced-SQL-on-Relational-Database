# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project explores pizza sales data from a relational MySQL database using advanced SQL queries. It demonstrates both fundamental and advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful business insights.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses a relational database (`pizza_db`) containing:
- `orders`: order timestamps and IDs
- `order_details`: pizza quantities ordered
- `pizzas`: pizza sizes and prices

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Total number of orders placed
- Total revenue generated from pizza sales
- Most popular pizza size and type
- Highest priced pizza and top revenue generators
- Category-wise sales and revenue distribution
- Time-based ordering trends (hourly, daily)
- Cumulative revenue tracking over time

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- INNER JOINs and Subqueries
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Grouping and Ordering
- Window Functions (RANK, CUMULATIVE SUM)
- Date and Time Functions

## 📈 Outcomes
The project provided valuable insights like:
- Which pizza types are top sellers
- Revenue contribution by category
- Sales patterns by hour and day
- Data-driven recommendations for promotions

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Database Exploration & Modeling
- Business Intelligence Querying
- Query Optimization
